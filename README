MOTIVATION

Addendum was written after I was tripped up by automatic schema updates
via JPA and Hiberate. The automatic updates were not magic enough to
implement all of the changes I wanted to see in my underlying schema.

Additionally, there was a time when changes to file system directory
structures accompanied a schema update. I wanted to run some Java code
to shuffle the files, based on the changes to the schema.

Automatic building of schemas by Hibernate created more problems than it
solved. Addendum builds a database from a bootstrap point, adding
changes one after another.

Assuming a linear progression of changes, updates and not merges, you
can deploy an application and have it patch the schema from where ever
it last left off.
