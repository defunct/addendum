MOTIVATION

This is the solution for using JPA annotations to define addendums, by exporting
the state of the class models to a addendum Definition. Previously, I'd
attempted to create addendums from JPA annotations by reflecting on the classes
in the migration definition. Of course, when the classes were refeactored, the
reflections would only optain new class and property names and the old names
were no longer avaialble through reflection. I'd have to go back and note that
when a paritcular class was created, it really had a different name, introducing
a lot of fiddly, typo prone strings.

Given that refactoring is what Addendum is supposed to simplify, I developed
this solution of taking a snapshot of the definitions obtained through
relfection on JPA annotated classes and writing them out a definition class.
Then you can check the definition class into source control, so that the state
is remembered. It is generated via relfection so it is not typo prone. You can
used however much or little of the definition as is necessary to generate your
migrations, ignoring the parts that have not changed.
